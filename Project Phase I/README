I.  What I have done in this assignment?

    In this socket-programming project, I implemented the simulation of a house
    selling process, which mainly using tcp and udp sockets to send and receive
    information from sellers, agents and buyers.

    Since there are multiple sellers and buyers, I use fork() function in Agent
    code to create multiple child sockets to receive and send message to sellers
    and buyers. And I store information in a local txt file when using fork().

    I tested all code both on my local Ubuntu and remote nunki server.

II. Implementations

    1. Agent

        The workflow of Agent is as follows:

            a. Create and bind to the TCP server socket.
            b. Accept TCP connections from the corresponding sellers.
            d. Receive property information from sellers over TCP.
            e. Store property information in a temporary local file.
            f. Create UDP client socket.
            g. Send property information to all five buyers over UDP.
            h. Receive buyers response over TCP.
            i. Calculate final result for his sellers.
            j. Create TCP client socket.
            k. Send final result to his sellers and corresponding buyers over TCP.

    2. Seller

        The workflow of Seller is as follows:

            a. Create TCP client socket and connect with Agent.
            b. Read his property information from local text file.
            c. Send his property information to his agent over TCP.
            d. Create TCP server socket.
            e. Receive final result from agent over TCP.

    3. Buyer

        The workflow of Buyer is as follows:

            a. Create UDP server socket.
            b. Receive property information from agents over UDP.
            c. Read his requirement information from local text file.
            d. Compare the property information with his requirement and get a decision.
            e. Create TCP client socket.
	    f. Send his decision to agents over TCP.
            g. Create TCP server socket.
            h. Receive final result from agent over TCP.

III. How to run the programs:

    *** Put all "seller.txt" files under a folder named "seller" ***
    *** Put all "buyer.txt" files under a folder named "buyer" ***

    1. First open 11 different terminal window instances.

    2. Use one terminal and type "make all" to compile all the cpp files.

    3. In the first 2 terminals, type the following commands in order:
      
        Agent1
        Agent2

    4. In the next 5 terminals, type the following commands in order:

        Buyer1
        Buyer2
        Buyer3
        Buyer4
        Buyer5

    5. In the final 4 terminals, type the following commands in order:

        SellerA
        SellerB
        SellerC
        SellerD

================================================================================

IV.  Message Format

    The message format is as follows.

    1. Seller sends message (its property information) to agent.
       <[SellerX],[Listing price],[xxx],[Square footage],[xxx]>

    2. Agents sends message (property information) to all buyers.
       Each agent send message containing two pieces of information.
       <[SellerX],[Listing price],[xxx],[Square footage],[xxx],
        [SellerY],[Listing price],[xxx],[Square footage],[xxx]>

    3. Buyer sends to message (his decision) to agents.
       <[BuyerX],[SellerX],[xxx(budget)]>      

    4. Agent sends final result to seller.
       <[BuyerX]>

    5. Agent sends final result to buyer.
       <[SellerX]>

V. Reused Code

        a. Read local txt file function code is reused from my lab1

        b. Integer to String function code is reused from my lab2
